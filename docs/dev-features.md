# Dev feature selection

Lust dev builds can use a different Cargo feature set than the shipped
Cargo release build. The main use is a feature lust does not need in the
dev loop, such as a native allocator. A build without the feature is
still valid Rust when the crate keeps a `#[cfg(not(feature = ...))]`
fallback, so rule zero holds. Only the dev build changes: Cargo release
builds never read this config.

## Config

Put one of these in the crate `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package.metadata.lust]
# Remove names from the package `default` list for lust dev builds.
dev-exclude-features = ["jemalloc"]
```

```toml
[package.metadata.lust]
# Or give the exact dev list. This implies no default features.
dev-features = ["fast"]
```

Use only one key. If both are present, `dev-features` wins.

A workspace can set the config for its members in the workspace root:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.lust]
dev-exclude-features = ["jemalloc"]
```

A `.lust.toml` file with top-level keys also works. Lust reads the
nearest `.lust.toml` at or above the crate directory:

```toml
dev-exclude-features = ["jemalloc"]
```

Lookup order, first config found wins:

1. `[package.metadata.lust]` in the crate manifest.
2. `[workspace.metadata.lust]` in an ancestor manifest.
3. `.lust.toml` at or above the crate directory.

## How a plain dev command uses it

No flags are needed:

```sh
lust check src/lib.rs --manifest-path Cargo.toml --lib
lust build src/main.rs --manifest-path Cargo.toml
lust check crates/ts_goport/src/program.rs
```

When the command line names no feature selection, lust reads the
config, computes the effective list (`default` minus the excluded
names, or the exact `dev-features` list), and stores that list in the
session key as `--features <list>` with default features off. The
daemon session key, the graph key, and the disk cache key all carry the
effective list, so an edit to the config or to `default` starts a fresh
session.

Command line flags always win: any of `--features`,
`--no-default-features`, or `--all-features` on the command disables
the config for that call. To check the release feature set with lust,
pass the flags by hand, for example `--features jemalloc`.

`dev-exclude-features` removes names from the top `default` list only.
If a kept feature enables an excluded one by transitivity, Cargo still
enables it. Fix the config or the feature table in that case.

## Example: ts-rust `jemalloc`

`crates/ts_goport` is the only ts-rust crate with a `jemalloc` feature:

- `crates/ts_goport/Cargo.toml`: `default = ["jemalloc"]`, and
  `jemalloc = ["dep:tikv-jemallocator", "dep:tikv-jemalloc-ctl"]`
  (target-gated to non-Windows, non-wasm). No other crate declares it.
  `crates/ts_wasm` already depends on `ts_goport` with
  `default-features = false`.
- The bin targets (`src/bin/tsgo.rs`, `goport.rs`, `goport_build.rs`,
  `goport_emit.rs`, `goport_typesyms.rs`) install
  `tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc` as `#[global_allocator]` only under
  `#[cfg(all(feature = "jemalloc", not(windows)))]`.
- `src/program.rs` reads and writes `thread.arena` through
  `tikv_jemalloc_ctl` only under the same cfg, with a plain fallback.
- `src/jemalloc_layout.rs` is mounted only under
  `#[cfg(all(feature = "jemalloc", target_os = "linux"))]`.

Decision (Theo): lust dev builds of ts-rust run with `jemalloc` off.
Release builds by Cargo keep it. Add `.lust.toml` at the ts-rust
workspace root, or the `[workspace.metadata.lust]` table in the root
`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
dev-exclude-features = ["jemalloc"]
```

Effect: lust dev builds use the system allocator fallback. Allocation
speed and the parse thread counts chosen under
`cfg!(feature = "jemalloc")` in `program.rs` differ in dev builds. That
is accepted. The shipped binary is unchanged.

## Example: ts-rust `backtrace`

`crates/ts_goport` feature `backtrace` (default on) gates the
`GOPORT_TRACE` debug output of tsgo's panic hook (`src/bin/tsgo.rs`).
The fork's `.lust.toml` excludes it: a backtrace's text depends on the
compiler's symbols and cannot match Cargo's byte for byte.
`scripts/tsrust_parity.py` removes `GOPORT_TRACE` from its runs.

## Tools

- `lust-port scan` reads the same config and evaluates
  `cfg(feature = ...)` with the effective dev features of each package
  (config, else the package defaults). Flags `--cargo-features <a,b>`
  and `--cargo-exclude-features <a,b>` override the config for one
  scan. The report JSON lists the effective features per package.
- `scripts/port-scan-sync.py --coverage` passes
  `LUST_DEV_EXCLUDE_FEATURES` (comma list) or `LUST_DEV_FEATURES`
  through to the scanner when they are set, so a scan of a read-only
  tree can still use the dev selection.
- `bench/slices/prune.py` reads the config from the ts-rust tree (or
  `--dev-features` / `--dev-exclude-features` / the same env vars),
  passes the effective list to lust and to its rustc oracle, and
  records `dev_features` in `prune.json`. `scripts/speed_slice.py`
  replays that list for both lust and Cargo on the slice crate.
