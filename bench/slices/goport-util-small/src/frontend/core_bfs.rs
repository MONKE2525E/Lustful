//! Go `internal/core/bfs.go`.
//!
//! PORT: the language service runs on one dispatch thread
//! (`project/dirty/interfaces.rs`, decision 1). Go runs each level's jobs in
//! goroutines; the port runs them serially in queue order. Go starts every
//! goroutine of a level before a slow `visit` returns, so in Go's common
//! schedule each job passes its start check (`core/bfs.go:102`) and is
//! visited. The port follows that schedule: it visits every job of the
//! level and keeps only the check after the visit (`core/bfs.go:128`), so
//! the result and the next level are Go's deterministic ones. The side
//! effects of `visit` (the project search creates and loads each project of
//! the level) are those of Go's common schedule.
//!
//! Go's other schedule has no condition that the port can read: a later
//! job skips its visit only when its goroutine runs the start check after
//! an earlier job's `visit` has stored `lowestGoal`. That can happen only
//! when the earlier visit is fast (a project that is already loaded and up
//! to date, as at a hono reopen), and then it depends on the scheduler and
//! the CPU: Go N skipped hono's spec project in 5 of 7 reopens on
//! mini-743d, took the common schedule in both runs on alvin
//! (projsearch1b), and skipped it in about 4 of 15 reopens for the R170
//! reviewer. Both answers are Go's. The port keeps the
//! common one, so its answers (willRenameFiles: 11 files, 2 tests) do not
//! change from run to run or host to host.

// Go: core/bfs.go:21 BreadthFirstSearchLevel
// PORT: Go holds a pointer to the level's `OrderedMap`. The port moves the
// map in for the `PreprocessLevel` call and back out after it. `RefCell`
// lets a `Range` callback call `Delete` on the same level, as Go does.

// Go: core/bfs.go:53 BreadthFirstSearchParallel
// BreadthFirstSearchParallel performs a breadth-first search on a graph
// starting from the given node. It processes nodes in parallel and returns the path
// from the first node that satisfies the `visit` function back to the start node.

// Go: core/bfs.go:76 result (local type of BreadthFirstSearchParallelEx)

// Go: core/bfs.go:64 BreadthFirstSearchParallelEx
// BreadthFirstSearchParallelEx is an extension of BreadthFirstSearchParallel that allows
// the caller to pass a pre-seeded set of already-visited nodes and a preprocessing function
// that can be used to remove nodes from each level before parallel processing.

// Go: core/bfs.go:86 processLevel (closure in BreadthFirstSearchParallelEx)
// processLevel processes each node at the current level in parallel.
// It produces either a list of jobs to be processed in the next level,
// or a result if the visit function returns true for any node.
// PORT: a function with the closure's captures as parameters. The job
// goroutines run serially in queue order.

// Go: core/bfs.go:169 createPath (closure in BreadthFirstSearchParallelEx)

// Go: core/bfs.go:196 updateMin
// updateMin updates the atomic integer `a` to the candidate value if it is less than the current value.
