"""Oracle log counting for the daemon sweeps: the patch oracle (LUST_CHECK_ITEMPATCH=1,
src/driver/item_oracle.rs) and the resolve oracle (LUST_CHECK_RESOLVE=1,
src/driver/resolve_oracle.rs).

Each daemon a sweep starts writes its oracle lines to its own log (`setup`). After the daemon
stops, `collect` counts them and appends them to the caller's LUST_ITEMPATCH_LOG, if set (so
scripts/itempatch-sweep.sh sees every line). `problems` turns the counts into failures: any line
but `itempatch oracle: ok ...` or `resolve oracle: ok ...` fails, and so does a run with no `ok`
line at all (the oracle saw nothing, as on the single-file chunk path before it was covered).
