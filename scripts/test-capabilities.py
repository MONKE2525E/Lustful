"""Keeps `lust capabilities` true: runs the probes in tests/capabilities/.

Each probe names the capability lines it shows, then what lust must do:

    // capability: <section>: <line text, exactly as `lust capabilities --json` prints it>
    // expect: ok | L####
    // command: test        (optional; default `run` for ok, `check` for a code)

`ok` means the command exits 0 (the supported probes assert their own results and
print them, so a sweep can compare them with rustc). `L####` means lust reports that
code; for a rejected line it must be the line's own code. The test fails when:
  - a probe names a line the list does not have (the line changed or went away),
  - a supported probe does not run or a rejected probe is not rejected with its code,
  - a line in a checked section has no probe and is not in UNPROBED.

Usage: scripts/test-capabilities.py [lust binary]   (default target/release/lust)
