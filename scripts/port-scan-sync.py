"""Refresh tools/lust-port/features.json by testing lust against rustc.

Each probe in tools/lust-port/tests/features/ is one small program for
one feature id. This script builds it with rustc (edition 2024) and
with `lust check` plus `lust run`, then derives one status per
feature: supported (every probe matches rustc), partial (some probes
match), or unsupported (no probe matches). A lust build that runs with
wrong output is a false accept and fails the run.

Modes:
  (default)       run the probes and print the status table
  --write         also write status and milestone into features.json
                  (supported sets milestone 0; notes stay hand-written)
  --check         write nothing; exit 1 and list every feature whose
                  committed status (or supported milestone) differs
                  from the probe result on this tree. Statuses come
                  only from probes, so --check needs no ts-rust
                  checkout. scripts/port-sync-check.sh is the gate
                  form of this mode.
  --coverage      run lust-port on ts-rust, refresh docs/ts-rust-gaps.json,
                  and write docs/ts-rust-coverage.md for the core CLI scope

Probes are independent: --jobs N runs N at a time (default: CPU
count, max 8; 1 is serial). Each probe gets its own work dir (rustc
binary, lust cache, Cargo target, run working directory), so
parallel probes cannot see each other's files.

A timeout is never a status. A compile step that passes its time
limit (exit 124 from run()), is killed by a signal, or (for a lust
compile) fails with no L#### diagnostic gives verdict "timeout",
not a reject: under gate load a healthy lust compile can pass the
limit or die from the load, and reading that as a reject flips a
supported feature to unsupported (the ext.rustix gate failures; a
real lust reject always carries an L#### code). Such a probe runs
once more, serially after the pool, with the long RETRY_* limits.
If it still is not judged, --check fails that feature as a timeout
(not a status mismatch) and --write keeps its committed status and
warns. Each probe result records its wall time in "secs" (first
try plus any retry), and the run prints the slowest probes.

Probes with `// oracle: lust-only` have no single-file rustc oracle
(a proc macro). They never set supported by themselves: a lust reject
records unsupported, a lust accept is reported for a human call.

Probes with `// cargo-dep: <dependency line>` headers (one per line,
as written under [dependencies]) use a registry crate: the probe runs
as the bin of a temporary Cargo package with those dependencies. Cargo
builds and runs it against the real crate (offline, from the local
registry cache) as the oracle, and lust builds it from the same
manifest, which swaps in the lust adapter (docs/ARCH.md 3.6).

Env: LUST (lust binary), LUST_PORT (scanner binary), TS_RUST (ts-rust
checkout), LUST_TCC_HOME (passed through to lust). Per-step time
limits in seconds (floats allowed) can be set for tests:
PORT_SCAN_COMPILE_TIMEOUT, PORT_SCAN_RUN_TIMEOUT,
PORT_SCAN_CARGO_TIMEOUT, and the retry forms
PORT_SCAN_RETRY_COMPILE_TIMEOUT, PORT_SCAN_RETRY_RUN_TIMEOUT and
PORT_SCAN_RETRY_CARGO_TIMEOUT.
