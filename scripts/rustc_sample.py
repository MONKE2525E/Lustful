# rustc_sample.py: a cheap rule-zero oracle for fuzz lanes. A fuzz lane offers each program
# that lust accepts; this keeps a uniform sample (reservoir, own RNG, duplicates dropped) of
# at most N of them, then builds each with rustc at its default lint levels (a full build:
# `--emit=metadata` misses deny-by-default lints such as unconditional_panic). A rustc
# rejection is a failure: lust accepted a program that is not valid Rust. A rustc timeout is
# counted, never judged.
#   fuzz.py run --rustc-sample N   (Sample in-process)
#   rustc_sample.py N SEED OUTDIR FILE...   (parse-fuzz.sh: the files lust accepted)
# The CLI prints "rustc sample: <k> built, <r> rejected, <t> timeouts, of <a> accepted" and
# exits 1 when r > 0. Rejected programs are copied to OUTDIR as rustc-reject-<i>.rs.
#
# RunSample (fuzz.py run --rustc-run-sample N): a sample of accepted states that also ran
# warm and cold under lust, kept per semantic family (the edit op that made the state), so
# the common scalar edits cannot fill it. At the end each state is built and run with rustc,
# and its stdout, exit status and normalized stderr must equal both lust runs. A rustc run
# timeout is unjudged (the family's spare states take its place); fewer judged states than
# the minimum is a failure. Mismatches are copied to OUTDIR as rustc-run-mismatch-<i>.rs.
