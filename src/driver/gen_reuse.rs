// Generic-program reuse across daemon requests (docs/ARCH.md section 8;
// W-PERF wave B). Collect checks every template once against its bounds
// (`generics::template_check`) and runs instance discovery over every
// plain fn and every instance it makes (`generics::materialize`). This
// cache keeps both results per stable def across the requests of one
// daemon session, so collect checks only the bodies an edit touched and
// replays the rest in the cold order.
//
// A stored result depends on three things, and holds while all three do:
// - the trait system: trait items, impl items of lang and foreign
//   traits, and inherent impls with an associated const or a `dyn` Self,
//   each as written and resolved (`trait_key`). Collect drops every
//   entry when their fingerprint changes (`GenReuse::gate`), and the
//   driver also drops them on a const fn body edit, a nested static, or
//   a slot renumber (`compile.rs`, "generic reuse"). Derive lists are
//   not in the key (PLAN R12): every answer that reads one records a
//   `Derives` read (check/derive_delta.rs), so a derive edit rechecks
//   only the bodies that asked; codegen's reads join each slot's read
//   set, and a build regenerates the glue on a derive edit
//   (`build_derives_moved`). Impls of user traits are not in the key:
//   selection records an `ImplSet` read of the bucket it searched
//   (driver/graph.rs), so an added, removed, or edited user trait impl
//   rechecks only the bodies that read its bucket. Other inherent impls
//   are not in it either: method probes and inherent table lookups
//   record `MethodSet` reads (`Program::inherent_reads`).
// - the source: the body and head hash of the AST fn whose text the
//   body checks, and what the body takes from other checks in this
//   collect. An instance's source is its template's source plus the
//   template check's outputs it replays (picks, closure call kinds and
//   shapes): its own reads miss the probes that chose those picks. A
//   closure body fn's source is its parent's plus the closure record the
//   parent's check made. A trait default method's text is part of its
//   trait item, under the first key.
// - everything else the check read (section 8.2 `Reads`: bindings,
//   method sets, signatures with generics and bounds, layouts). An entry
//   made under another item-level environment replays its reads against
//   this program first.
