// The `Defs` table skeleton (docs/ARCH.md section 2.2, serial refactor S3a).
//
// One table per crate maps each `DefId` to its definition record: kind, parent,
// name, generics, and a per-kind signature payload with resolved types only (a
// signature may hold `Param`, `Projection`, and `Opaque`, never `Infer`). Today the
// payloads that already exist stay where they are behind compat queries: struct and
// enum fields live in `check::collect::AdtDef` (reached by `local_adt`), and fn
// params and returns in `FnInfo`. `Defs` owns identity, kind, parent, generics, and
// param envs now; W-TRAITS-CORE moves payloads in as generic collect lands. All
// signature reads that would walk raw predicate lists for supertraits go through
// `param_env` instead (ARCH 2.1).
